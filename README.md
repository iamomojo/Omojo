Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Ever met a daytime Supply Chain specialist and late-night **Data Analyst**?
Well, that's me! I'm a self taught Data Analyst with a background in multiple aspects of the supply chain which speak to my abilities in the following  
 + Negotiation/value creation (will save you lots of money)
+ Collaboration with both internal & external stakeholders
+ Disciplined, proactive and use initiative, with the ability to work with little or no supervision
+ Organization/efficiency (able to plan, organize, manage schedules and budgets)
+ Communication (able to present ideas in the simplest possible form)
+ Project Management (in addition to my experience, I am PMPÂ® SMCÂ®, so this means that I can take on projects from conception to closure) 
+ Analytics (able to torture data until it confesses to something~ I learned that from Ronald Coase) ðŸ˜Š 

#### **My Technical Skills**:
R | SQL| JiRA| Tableau| PowerBI| Anaplan| Confluence    
I am **currently learning**...drumroll please.....**Python**

Outside of work, I love searching things out (some of us never outgrow hide 'n' seek), I also love arranging spaces ðŸŒ± and teaching Maths to elementary school kids.

Want to know more about me ðŸ“«, feel free to **connect with me** via
